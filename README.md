This repo contains some ablations results and code for Grendel. 
Abaltions results are based on the newest INRIA Gaussian Splatting
code (https://github.com/graphdeco-inria/gaussian-splatting/commit/54c035f7834b564019656c3e3fcc3646292f727d).
We only include files changed from the original code here.

The plots are under `ablation_plots` folder.
